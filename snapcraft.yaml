summary: ALSA part for snapcraft
description: |
  ALSA part for snapcraft, which will compile ALSA and install a loader script
  which redirects audio through pulseaudio without requiring the `alsa` plug to
  be connected manually or by store assertion.

  See the instructions for implementing into your Snap build at
  https://snapcraft-alsa.readthedocs.io/.

### START parts
parts:
  alsa-mixin:
    plugin: dump
    source: https://github.com/diddlesnaps/snapcraft-alsa.git
    source-subdir: snapcraft-assets
    build-packages:
      - libasound2-dev
    stage-packages:
      - libasound2
      - libasound2-plugins
      - yad
    stage:
      # restrict to only audio-related files - you need to ensure
      # that gtk3 is staged for yad to work correctly, to prompt
      # users to connect the alsa plug or proceed with pulseaudio.
      #
      # This helps prevent symbol conflicts in situations where
      # you're using a non-default library, such as those that the
      # gnome-3-34 extension for core18 provides.
